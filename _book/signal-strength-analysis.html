<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Signal Strength Analysis</h1>
<p>We have used visualization and statistical summaries to help clean and format the data, and now we turn to investigating the properties of the response variable, signal strength. We want to learn more about how the signals behave before designing a model for IPS. The following questions guide us in our investigations.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have measured the signal strength to an access point multiple times at each location and orientation. How do these signal strengths behave? That is, what is the distribution of the repeated measurements at each location and orientation? Does signal strength behave similarly at all locations? Or do the location, orientation, and access point affect this distribution?</li>
<li>In a laboratory setting, signal strength decays linearly with log distance and a simple triangulation using the signal strength from 3 access points can accurately pinpoint the location of a device. In practice, physical characteristics of a building and human activity can add significant noise to signal strength measurements. How can we characterize the relationship between the signal strength and the distance from the device to the access point? How does the orientation affect this relationship? Is this relationship the same for all access points?</li>
</ul>
<p>We consider these questions in the next two chapters.</p>
<div id="distribution-of-signal-strength" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Distribution of Signal Strength</h2>
<p>We want to compare the distribution of signal strength at different orientations and for different access points, so we need to subdivide our data. We are interested in seeing if these distributions are normal or skewed. We also want to look at their variances.</p>
<p>We consider the impact of orientation on signal strength by fixing a location on the map to see how the signal changes as the experimenter rotates through the 8 angles. We also separately examine the MAC addresses because, for example, at an orientation of 90 degrees the experimenter may be facing toward one access point and away from another.</p>

</div>
<p>We see in Figure <a href="signal-strength-analysis.html#fig:boxplots-orientation">4.1</a> that the signal strength varies with the orientation for both close and distant access points. Note we have dropped the records for the MAC address of <code>00:0f:a3:39:dd:cd</code> because it is identified as the extra address in the next chapter.</p>
<p>Recall from the summary statistics that signal strengths are measured in negative values. That is,</p>

<p>The small values, such as -98, correspond to weak signals and the large values, such as -25, are the strong signals.</p>
<p>When we examine a few other locations, we find a similar dependence of signal strength on angle. For example, we compare the distributions of signal strength for different angles and MAC addresses at the central location of <span class="math inline">\(x = 23\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y = 4\)</span>.</p>

<p>Many of these distributions look approximately normal, but there are some serious departures with secondary modes and skewness (see Figure <a href="signal-strength-analysis.html#fig:density-orientation">4.2</a>). Also, the center of the distribution varies with angle and MAC address, which indicates that conditioning on angle and MAC address is warranted.</p>
<p>If we want to examine the distribution of signal strength for all 166 locations, 8 angles, and 6 access points, we need to create thousands of boxplots or density curves. We can, instead, examine summary statistics such as the mean and SD or the median and IQR of signal strength for all location–orientation–access point combinations. For each combination, we have roughly 100 observations.</p>

</div>
<p>From Figure <a href="signal-strength-analysis.html#fig:offline-skewness">4.4</a> we see that these two measures of centrality are similar to each other; they typically differ by less than 1 to 2 dBm.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-relationship-between-signal-and-distance" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> The Relationship between Signal and Distance</h2>
<p>One way to examine the relationship between distance and signal strength is to smooth the signal strength over the region where it is measured and create a contour plot, similar to a topographical map; that portion of the floor plan where there is strong signal corresponds to the mountainous regions in the contour map. As with our previous analysis of signal strength, we want to control for the access point and orientation. Let’s begin by selecting one MAC address and one orientation to examine. We choose the summary statistics for an angle×MAC address combination with, e.g.,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">one_ap_angle &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>offline <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>
<span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">filter</span>(mac <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> </span>top_macs[<span class="dv">5</span>], angle <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">0</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>We can make a topographical map using color, i.e., a heat map. The <code>fields</code> package uses the method of thin plate splines to fit a surface to the signal strength values at the observed locations. This package also provides plotting routines for visualizing the surface with a heat map. The <code>Tps()</code> function in <code>fields</code> requires that we provide a unique “z” value for each <span class="math inline">\((x, y)\)</span> so we must summarize our signal strengths. Rather than use <code>offline</code>, which gives, in <code>one_ap_angle</code>, about 100 recordings of signal strength at each location, we subset <code>offline_summary</code> with</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">one_ap_angle &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>offline_summary <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span>

<p>Then, after loading <code>fields</code>, we call <code>Tps()</code> to fit a smooth surface to mean signal strength:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(fields)
smooth_ss &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>one_ap_angle <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span>
<span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">select</span>(posX, posY) <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span>
<span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">Tps</span>(one_ap_angle<span class="op">$</span>mean)</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we use <code>predictSurface()</code> to predict the value for the fitted surface at a grid of the observed <code>posX</code> and <code>posY</code> values, i.e.,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">viz_smooth &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">predictSurface</span>(smooth_ss)</code></pre></div>
<p>Then we plot the predicted signal strength values using <code>plot.surface()</code> as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">plot.surface</span>(viz_smooth, <span class="dt">type =</span> <span class="st">&#39;C&#39;</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p><img src="_main_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>Lastly, we add the locations where the measurements were taken:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">points</span>(one_ap_angle<span class="op">$</span>posX, one_ap_angle<span class="op">$</span>posY, <span class="dt">pch =</span> <span class="dv">19</span>, <span class="dt">cex =</span> <span class="fl">0.5</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>We can wrap this plotting routine into its own function so that we can parameterize the MAC address and angle, and if desired, other plotting parameters. Our function, called <code>surfaceSS()</code>, has 3 arguments: data for the offline summary data frame, and <code>mac</code> and <code>angle</code>, which supply the MAC address and angle to select the subset of the data that we want smoothed and plotted.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">surfaceSS &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="cf">function</span>(df, m, a, ...) {

  <span class="kw">invisible</span>(one_ap_angle)
}</code></pre></div>
<p>We call <code>surfaceSS()</code> with a couple of MAC addresses and angles to compare them. To do this, we first modify R’s plotting parameters so that we can place 4 contour plots on one canvas, and we reduce the size allocated to the margins so more of the canvas is dedicated to the heat maps. We save the current settings for the plotting parameters in <code>par_cur</code>, and then we make 4 calls to our <code>surfaceSS()</code> function using <code>purrr::pwalk()</code> as follows:</p>

<p>In Figure <a href="signal-strength-analysis.html#fig:mean-signal">4.5</a> we see that we can easily identify the location of the access point as the dark red region at the top of the “mountain.” We also confirm the effect of the orientation on signal strength. Additionally, a corridor effect emerges. The signal is stronger relative to distance along the corridors where the signals are not blocked by walls.</p>
<p>We know the locations of the access points based on the floor plan of the building, but we have not been given their exact location and we do not know the mapping between MAC address and access point. Fortunately, the contour maps that we just created make it easy to connect the MAC address to the access point marked on the floor plan in Figure <a href="rawdata.html#fig:floorplan">2.1</a>. For example, from Figure <a href="signal-strength-analysis.html#fig:mean-signal">4.5</a>, the signals appearing in the top row of the plot clearly correspond to the access point in the top left corner of the building. Also, according to the documentation, the training data were measured at 1 meter intervals in the building so we can use the grey dots on the plan to estimate the location of the access points. We find that two MAC addresses have similar heat maps and these both correspond to the access point near the center of the building (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(x = 7.5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y = 6.3\)</span>). We choose the first of these and leave as an exercise the analysis of the impact of this decision on predicting location.</p>

<p>To examine the relationship between signal strength and distance from the access point, we need to compute the distances from the locations of the device emitting the signal to the access point receiving the signal. We first compute the difference between the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> coordinate and access point’s <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> coordinate and the similar difference for the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> coordinates. Then we use these differences to find the Euclidean distance between the position of the hand-held device and the access point. We can do all this with</p>

<p>The scatter plots appear in Figure <a href="signal-strength-analysis.html#fig:signal-distance">4.6</a>. There appears to be curvature in the plots. A log transformation might improve the relationship. However, the signals are negative values so we need to be careful in taking a log transformation. We leave it to the reader to further investigate this relationship between signal strength and distance.</p>
